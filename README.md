GPU-Accelerated Matrix Multiplication
This project demonstrates optimized matrix multiplication using CUDA, achieving significant performance improvements over CPU-only implementations. By leveraging GPU parallelism, shared memory, and thread synchronization, the program achieves up to a 50% reduction in runtime.

Features
CUDA Optimization: Implements GPU-accelerated matrix multiplication.
Performance Gains: Achieves a 50% runtime reduction compared to CPU-only solutions.
Efficient Memory Usage: Utilizes shared memory and thread synchronization for enhanced parallel processing.
Compatibility: Designed and tested on NVIDIA GPUs.
Prerequisites
CUDA Toolkit: Ensure you have CUDA installed. Download CUDA Toolkit
C++ Compiler: A compatible C++ compiler (e.g., GCC).
NVIDIA GPU: Required for running CUDA programs.
Installation
Clone the repository:
Copy
git clone 
cd 
Compile the program:
Copy
nvcc matrix_multiplication.cu -o matrix_multiplication
